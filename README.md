# Parkinson's Disease Prediction using Machine Learning  

This project explores **machine learning techniques** for predicting Parkinson's disease from biomedical voice measurements.  
It is implemented as part of my AI in Biomedical Engineering learning journey.  

#  Project Overview
Day 1: Regression models  
  - Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, SVR, RandomForest, GradientBoosting  
  - Evaluation using MAE, RMSE, R²  

  Day 2: Classification models  
  - Logistic Regression, SVM, RandomForest, GradientBoosting  
  - Evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Confusion Matrix  

#  Dataset
